What is FRITS?

* FRITS stands for First Randstad Internal Token Share

What is the concept behind FRITS?

* The FRITS concept is that Randstad employees are encouraged to share their (hidden) talents and relevant content. For example, a UX designer who gives a UX training to colleagues for 1 FRITS in the evening. The received FRITS can be used by the UX designer to follow a Yoga lesson from another colleague. All new employees get FRITS when they are employed and can also earn this by being rewarded by colleagues when writing relevant content on the intranet.
